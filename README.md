DEFCONtastic client for WHAD
============================

This small client has been developed during DEF CON 32, mostly to discover and
play with [WHAD](https://whad.io). It basically parses the DEFCONtastic QR link
to configure the hardware radio interface and then uses it to receive any message
and send user message into the target channel.
